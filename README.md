# Cookbook Shop Management System üìñ

## üí°Overview 

The Cookbook Management System is a versatile platform built with the integrated Bootstrap framework, ensuring optimal responsiveness on various devices. The system caters to three distinct roles: Normal Staff, Supervisor, and Admin. Normal Staff, responsible for routine operations, has the ability to Create, Read, and Update (CRU) products and customer orders. Supervisors, with a more extensive role, can perform CRUD operations on products, customers, orders, order details, and invoices. Admins, holding the highest level of authority, possess the capability to Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) across all entities, ensuring comprehensive control over the entire cookbook inventory, staff, and customer-related information. This systematic breakdown of roles and permissions guarantees efficient management and a seamless experience for administrators, supervisors, and normal staffs alike within the Cookbook Management System.
